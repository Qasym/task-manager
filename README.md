# Description
This is my implementation of a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application
The implementation utilized Spring MVC, thus it contains all the code that handles the front end 
part as well

Feel free to edit the looks and/or functionality of this application

# Requirements

- Java 17
- Mongo DB host
    - It can be done locally using mongod
    - Or you can create a db online using Mongo Atlas
---
- Opening this project with Intellij Idea would be a good option as I developed this project using that IDE
- If you decide to use Mongo Atlas and host db on a remote server, don't forget to change the `application.properties` file
